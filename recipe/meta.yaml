    summary: 'AstoCAD is a parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. '
    description: |
        AstoCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for
        CAD, MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering
        and product design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering,
        such as architecture or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open
        Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing for very
        advanced extension and customization.
        AstoCAD is based on FreeCAD, a free and open source project.
